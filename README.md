## ðŸ§ª Development Notes

- All components are built with **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive UI.
- Data is fetched using **Server Components** or **API routes** (e.g., `/api/transactions`, `/api/budgets`).
- Charts use `recharts` for flexible and powerful data visualizations.
- All views auto-refresh using `useEffect` and `router.refresh()` after form actions.

## ðŸ”§ Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
